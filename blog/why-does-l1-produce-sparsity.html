    <article>
      <p>Supervised machine learning problems are typically of the form “minimize your error while regularizing your parameters.” The idea is that while many choices of parameters may make your training error low, the goal isn’t low training error – it’s low test-time error. Thus, parameters should be minimize training error while remaining “simple,” where the definition of “simple” is left up to the regularization function. Typically, supervised learning can be phrased as minimizing the following objective function,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  w^{*} = \arg\min_{w} \sum_{i} L(y_i, f(x_i; w)) + \lambda \Omega(w)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(L(y_i, f(x_i; w))\)</span> is the loss for predicting <span class="math">\(f(x_i; w)\)</span> when the true label is for sample <span class="math">\(i\)</span> is <span class="math">\(y_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Omega(w)\)</span> is a regularization function.</p>
<h1 id="sparsifying-regularizers">Sparsifying Regularizers</h1>
<p>There are many choices for <span class="math">\(\Omega(w)\)</span>, but the ones I’m going to talk about today are so called “sparsifying regularizers” such as <span class="math">\(||w||_1\)</span>. These norms are most often employed because they produce “sparse” <span class="math">\(w^{*}\)</span> – that is, <span class="math">\(w^{*}\)</span> with many zeros. This is in stark contrast to other regularizers such as <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}||w||_2^2\)</span> which leads to lots of small but nonzero entries in <span class="math">\(w^{*}\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="why-sparse-solutions">Why Sparse Solutions?</h1>
<p><strong>Feature Selection</strong> One of the key reasons people turn to sparsifying regularizers is that they lead to automatic feature selection. Quite often, many of the entries of <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> are irrelevant or uninformative to predicting the output <span class="math">\(y_i\)</span>. Minimizing the objective function using these extra features will lead to lower training error, but when the learned <span class="math">\(w^{*}\)</span> is employed at test-time it will depend on these features to be more informative than they are. By employing a sparsifying regularizer, the hope is that these features will automatically be eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretability</strong> A second reason for favoring sparse solutions is that the model is easier to interpret. For example, a simple sentiment classifier might use a binary vector where an entry is 1 if a word is present and 0 otherwise. If the resulting learned weights <span class="math">\(w^{*}\)</span> has only a few non-zero entries, we might believe that those are the most indicative words in deciding sentiment.</p>
<h1 id="non-smooth-regularizers-and-their-solutions">Non-smooth Regularizers and their Solutions</h1>
<p>We now come to the 100 million question: why do regularizers like the 1-norm lead to sparse solutions? At some point someone probably told you “they’re our best convex approximation to <span class="math">\(\ell_0\)</span> norm,” but there’s a better reason than that. In fact, I claim that any regularizer that is non-differentiable at <span class="math">\(w_i = 0\)</span> can lead to sparse solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Intuition</strong> The intuition lies in the idea of subgradients. Recall that the subgradient of a (convex) function <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is any vector <span class="math">\(v\)</span> such that,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  \Omega(y) \ge \Omega(x) + v^T (y-x)
\]</span></p>
<p>The set of all subgradients for <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is called the subdifferential and is denoted <span class="math">\(\partial \Omega(x)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\partial \Omega(x) = \{ \nabla \Omega(x) \}\)</span> – in other words, <span class="math">\(\partial \Omega(x)\)</span> contains 1 vector, the gradient. Where the subdifferential begins to matter is when <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> <em>isn’t</em> differentiable at <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Then, it becomes something more interesting.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to minimize an unconstrained objective like the following,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  \min_{x} f(x) + \lambda \Omega(x)
\]</span></p>
<p>By the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions">KKT conditions</a>, 0 must be in the subdifferential at the minimizer <span class="math">\(x^{*}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
  0 &amp; \in \nabla f(x^{*}) + \partial \lambda \Omega(x^{*}) \\
  - \frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(x^{*}) &amp; \in \partial \Omega(x^{*}) \\
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Looking forward, we’re particularly interested in when the previous inequality holds when <span class="math">\(x^{*} = 0\)</span>. What conditions are necessary for this to be true?</p>
<p><strong>Dual Norms</strong> Since we’re primarily concerned with <span class="math">\(\Omega(x) = ||x||_1\)</span>, let’s plug that in. In the following, it’ll actually be easier to prove things about any norm, so we’ll drop the 1 for the rest of this section.</p>
<p>Recal the definition of a dual norm. In particular, the dual norm of a norm <span class="math">\(||\cdot||\)</span> is defined as,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  ||y||_{*} = \sup_{||x|| \le 1} x^{T} y
\]</span></p>
<p>A cool fact is that the dual of a dual norm is the original norm. In other words,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  ||x|| = \sup_{||y||_{*} \le 1} y^{T} x
\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s take the gradient of the previous expression on both sides. A nice fact to keep in mind is that if we take the gradient of an expression of the form <span class="math">\(\sup_{y} g(y, x)\)</span>, then its gradient with respect to x is <span class="math">\(\nabla_x g(y^{*}, x)\)</span> where <span class="math">\(y^{*}\)</span> is any <span class="math">\(y\)</span> that achieves the <span class="math">\(\sup\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(g(y, x) = y^{T} x\)</span>, that means,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  \nabla_x \sup_{y} g(y, x) = \nabla_x \left( (y^{*})^T x \right) = y^{*} = \arg\max_{||y||_{*} \le 1} y^{T} x
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  \partial ||x|| = \{ y^{*} :  y^{*} = \arg\max_{||y||_{*} \le 1} y^{T} x \}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now let <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(y^{T} x = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, so any <span class="math">\(y\)</span> with <span class="math">\(||y||_{*} \le 1\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(\partial ||x||\)</span> for <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Back to our original goal, recall that</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  -\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(x) \in \partial ||x||
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(||-\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(x)||_{*} \le 1\)</span>, then we’ve already established that <span class="math">\(-\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(x)\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(\partial ||x||\)</span> for <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math">\(x^{*} = 0\)</span> solves the original problem!</p>
<h1 id="onto-coordinate-wise-sparsity">Onto Coordinate-wise Sparsity</h1>
<p>We’ve just established that <span class="math">\(||\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(0)||_{*} \le 1\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(x^{*} = 0\)</span>, but we don’t want all of <span class="math">\(x^{*}\)</span> to be 0, we want <em>some coordinates</em> of <span class="math">\(x^{*}\)</span> to be 0. How can we take what we just concluded and apply it only a subvector of <span class="math">\(x^{*}\)</span>?</p>
<p>Rather than a general norm, let’s return once again to the <span class="math">\(L_1\)</span> norm. The <span class="math">\(L_1\)</span> norm has a very special property that will be of use here: separability. In words, this means that the <span class="math">\(L_1\)</span> norm can be expressed as a sum of functions over <span class="math">\(x\)</span>’s individual coordinates, each independent of every other. In particular, <span class="math">\(||x||_1 = \sum_{i} |x_{i}|\)</span>. It’s easy to see that the function <span class="math">\(\Omega_i(x) = |x_i|\)</span> is independent of the rest of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>’s elements.</p>
<p>Let’s take another look at our objective function,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
  \min_{x} f(x) + \lambda ||x||_1
  &amp; = \min_{x_i} \left( \min_{x_{-i}} f(x_i, x_{-i}) + \lambda \sum_{j} |x_j| \right) \\
  &amp; = \min_{x_i} g(x_i) + \lambda |x_i|
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(x_{-i}\)</span> is all coordinates of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> except <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(x_i) = \min_{x_{-i}} f(x_i, x_{-i}) + \lambda \sum_{j \ne i} |x_j|\)</span>. Taking the derivative of <span class="math">\(g(x_i)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, we again require that,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
  0 &amp;\in \nabla_{x_i} g(x_i) + \lambda \partial |x_i| \\
  -\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla_{x_i} g(x_i) &amp; \in \partial |x_i| \\
  -\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla_{x_i} f(x_i, x_{-i}^{*}) &amp; \in \partial |x_i|
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Hmm, that looks familiar. And isn’t <span class="math">\(|x_i| = ||x_i||_1\)</span>? That means that if</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
  \left| \left| \frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla_{x_i} f(x_i, x_{-i}^{*}) \right| \right|_{\infty}
  = \left| \frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla_{x_i} f(x_i, x_{-i}^{*}) \right| \le 1
\]</span></p>
<p>when <span class="math">\(x_i = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x_i^{*} = 0\)</span>. In other words, given the optimal values for all coordinates other than <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, we can evaluate the derivative of <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{\lambda} f\)</span> with respect to <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> and check if the absolute value of that is less than 1. If it is, then <span class="math">\(x_i = 0\)</span> is optimal!</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the first section, we showed that in order to solve the problem <span class="math">\(\min_{x} f(x) + \lambda \Omega(x)\)</span>, it is necessary that <span class="math">\(-\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(x^{*}) \in \partial \Omega(x^{*})\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(\Omega(x^{*})\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math">\(x^{*}\)</span>, then there can be only 1 possible choice for <span class="math">\(x^{*}\)</span>, but in all other cases there are a multitude of potential solutions. When <span class="math">\(\Omega(x)\)</span> isn’t differentiable at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>, there is a non-singleton set of values which <span class="math">\(-\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(x^{*})\)</span> can be in such that <span class="math">\(x^{*} = 0\)</span> is still an optimal solution. If <span class="math">\(\Omega(x) = ||x||\)</span>, then a sufficient condition for <span class="math">\(x^{*} = 0\)</span> to be optimal is <span class="math">\(||\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla f(x)||_{*} \le 1\)</span> at <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the next section, we showed that in the special case of the <span class="math">\(L_1\)</span> norm, we can express the norm as the sum of <span class="math">\(L_1\)</span> norms applied to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>’s individual coordinates. Because of this, we can rewrite the original optimization problem as <span class="math">\(\min_{x_i} g(x_i) + \lambda ||x_i||_1\)</span> where <span class="math">\(g(x_i) = \min_{x_{-i}} f(x_i, x_{-i}) + \lambda ||x_{-i}||_1\)</span>. Using the same results from the previous section, we showed that as long as <span class="math">\(|\frac{1}{\lambda} \nabla_{x_i} f(x_i, x_{-i}^{*})| \le 1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x_i^{*} = 0\)</span> is an optimal choice. In other words, we established conditions upon which a coordinate will be 0. This is why the <span class="math">\(L_1\)</span> norm causes sparsity.</p>
